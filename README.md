### Context
Python Machine Learning Project as part of the DSTI Applied MSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 21 Cohort

### Why Twitch? 
Well it is a free live video streaming service that focuses on video games, esports, sports and lifestyle. Founded in 2011, it was acquired by Amazon. The Twitch audience, which are the consumers, have grown nearly triple since the covid Pandemic began back in March 2020. 

### Business Opportunity
Our Point of interest is in the Just Chatting section.  We are now living in a day of age where we no longer just watch TV, but now interact with it, An Engaged audience can bring live feedback every second. This feedback can be useful to the creator.  As you can see on your right-hand side is the twitch chat section.


### Project Objective
Gauge live feedback sentiment to help the those producing the live content to drive better quality and improve customer experience.
1. Extract and clean chat room data of few popular session
2. Analysis to find trends and patterns and visualize the results
3. Build an algorithm that can detect, analyze, and predict emotion/tone in a live chat event with multiple classification methods (Sentiment Analysis Tools and Machine Learning/Neural netowrks). 
4. integrate this model as an API extension into the twitch developer community webpage

We have always aimed to take the newer apprach similar an Agile Methodology.

We take a live twitch chat with python and log it, then do cleaning process to make a labeled dataset. We run 2 experiments, First being Sentiment Analysis with ML models, and Second, Time Series with both ML and Neural network models. Lastly, we feed both our models into the AWS architecture where the application is trained and then deployed onto the twitch platform.
